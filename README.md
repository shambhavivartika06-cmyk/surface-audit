Deterministic **security smoke tests** for staging, preview, and
pre-deploy web apps.

`surface-audit` sends a small, bounded set of safe probes at a **known
URL** and turns the result into CI-friendly findings, SARIF, Markdown,
HTML, and JSON reports. It is designed for teams that want to catch
security regressions in headers, TLS, redirects, cookies, CORS, exposed
files, and other surface-level mistakes **before** they promote a build.

> ⚠️ **Authorized use only.** This tool sends real HTTP requests to the
> target. Only run it against systems you own or have explicit written
> permission to test. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Why Teams Use It

- **Safe by default** — bounded checks against a known URL, not a crawler
  and not an exploit framework.
- **Regression-oriented** — baseline suppression and report diff help
  answer "what got worse?" instead of just "what exists?"
- **CI-native** — `--fail-on`, SARIF, Markdown, HTML, and JSON all fit
  cleanly into pull requests, code scanning, and release gates.
- **LLM-safe MCP support** — the optional MCP server exposes only a
  host allow-listed interface.
- **Extensible** — checks and renderers are pluggable via entry points.
- **Supply-chain aware** — PyPI Trusted Publishing, Sigstore signatures,
  GitHub Releases, and CycloneDX SBOMs are built into the release flow.

## Use It When

- you have a staging, preview, or pre-production URL
- you want a deterministic security gate in CI
- you care about security regressions between two deployments
- you want machine-readable output for SARIF, dashboards, or PR comments

## Reach for Other Tools When

- you need full crawling or spidering
- you need authenticated scanning workflows
- you want exploit confirmation or a broad template corpus

That positioning is deliberate: `surface-audit` is strongest as a
**pre-deploy security smoke test**, not as a full DAST platform.

## Quick Start

```bash
pipx install surface-audit

surface-audit scan https://preview.example.com \
    --scope-host preview.example.com \
    --fail-on HIGH
```

Detailed installation: [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md).

Container-first teams can use the published GHCR image on tagged releases:

### Pull the image
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dev-ugurkontel/surface-audit:latest
```
### Run the container
```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/dev-ugurkontel/surface-audit:latest \
  scan https://preview.example.com --fail-on HIGH
```

### Security Regression Diff

```bash
# Capture a baseline once
surface-audit scan https://preview.example.com \
    --output reports/baseline.json \
    --format json

# Gate only on newly introduced HIGH+ findings
surface-audit scan https://preview.example.com \
    --baseline reports/baseline.json \
    --fail-on HIGH

# Or diff two reports explicitly
surface-audit diff reports/before.json reports/after.json \
    --output reports/diff.json \
    --fail-on-new
```

## GitHub Action

The repository ships an action at the repo root so you can run the scan
in a preview-environment workflow without hand-rolling install steps:

```yaml
- name: Run surface-audit
  uses: dev-ugurkontel/surface-audit@v1
  with:
    target: ${{ steps.preview.outputs.url }}
    scope-hosts: preview.example.com
    output: reports/surface-audit.sarif
    format: sarif
    fail-on: HIGH

- name: Upload SARIF
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: reports/surface-audit.sarif
```

More end-to-end patterns: [`docs/RECIPES.md`](docs/RECIPES.md).

## Sample Output

```text
Target: https://preview.example.com/
Summary: HIGH 1  MEDIUM 2  LOW 1

HIGH     security-headers        Missing Content-Security-Policy header
MEDIUM   auth-cookies            Cookie 'sessionid' missing SameSite
MEDIUM   security-txt            Missing /.well-known/security.txt
LOW      directory-listing       Auto-generated index page exposed
```

Run `surface-audit list-checks` to see what is registered in your
environment (including any third-party plugins).

## Usage

```bash
# Save a JSON report and fail CI on HIGH+ findings
surface-audit scan https://example.com \
    --output reports/example.json --format json --fail-on HIGH

# Emit SARIF for GitHub Advanced Security
surface-audit scan https://example.com \
    --output reports/example.sarif --format sarif

# Run only a subset of checks
surface-audit scan https://example.com \
    --enable security-headers --enable ssl-tls
```

Full CLI and library reference: [`docs/USAGE.md`](docs/USAGE.md).

## MCP integration

```bash
pip install "surface-audit[mcp]"
surface-audit mcp-serve --allow-host staging.example.com
```

This exposes `scan`, `list_checks`, `list_formats`, and `render_report`
tools to local MCP clients while keeping scans gated behind an explicit
host allow-list.

## Library example

```python
import asyncio
from surface_audit import Scanner, ScannerConfig

async def main() -> None:
    report = await Scanner(
        "https://example.com",
        config=ScannerConfig(max_concurrency=4, timeout=5.0),
    ).run()
    for finding in report.findings:
        print(finding.severity.value, finding.check_id, finding.title)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Extend it

Any package shipping an entry point under `surface_audit.checks` adds a
check:

```toml
# your-plugin/pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points."surface_audit.checks"]
cors_wildcard = "my_checks.cors:PermissiveCORSCheck"
```

scorecard, and design patterns.
